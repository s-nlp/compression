      "Коммунистическая партия в Новосибирске проведет фестиваль оппозиционной прессы «День правды», который посвящен приближающемуся 140-летию со дня рождения генерального секретаря ЦК КПСС Иосифа Сталина, в центре города — Первомайском сквере, расположенном напротив мэрии. Об этом сообщается на сайте местного отделения партии. Отмечается, что на территории сквера развернут несколько тематических площадок, в том числе дискуссионную — «Сталин и современность», детскую — «Спасибо товарищу Сталину за наше счастливое детство!», интерактивную — «Сталинская экономика — было дело и цены снижали» и другие. На празднике новосибирские коммунисты также устроят «Битву диджеев» и рэп-фестиваль «Слова Правды». В завершение фестиваля пройдет флешмоб «Артиллеристы, Сталин дал приказ!» и прогремит фейерверк. Как пояснила «Ленте.ру» пресс-секретарь новосибирского комитета КПРФ Елена Карева, 140-летие со дня рождения Сталина решили отметить после того, как в Новосибирске открыли бюст советского вождя.\n",

      "В музее мадридского «Реала» появился бюст нападающего команды и сборной Португалии Криштиану Роналду. Об этом сообщает издание 101 Great Goals. Автором работы стал 52-летний Хосе Антонио Наварро Артеага. На создание скульптуры футболиста Артеагу вдохновил сын — большой поклонник Роналду. Бюст установили в музее 2 ноября, однако форвард не смог присутствовать на церемонии открытия. В марте 2017 года в терминале международного аэропорта португальского острова Мадейра уже был установлен памятник Роналду.\n",

      "Москву и Подмосковье не нужно объединять в один регион, заявил столичный мэр Сергей Собянин. Об этом в понедельник, 28 августа, сообщает «Интерфакс». «Я считаю, что никаких особых предпосылок для такого рода административных объединений нет, слишком огромные субъекты, около 20 миллионов человек. Я вижу на примере Новой Москвы, это требует колоссального количества времени, инвестиций, чтобы поднимать даже этот небольшой сегмент, что уж говорить обо всем регионе», — отметил он. По его словам, некоторое неудобство доставляет тот факт, что столица — одновременно и город, и субъект Федерации. «В других российских агломерациях, за исключением Санкт-Петербурга и Севастополя, вообще такой проблемы нет, города находятся внутри субъектов Российской Федерации.\n",
